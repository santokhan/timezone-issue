The issue you're describing is related to the time zone mismatch between your local machine and the VPS (Virtual Private Server). When you run a server locally, it uses the local machine's time zone, but when you run the server on a VPS, it uses the server's system time, which might be set to a different time zone.

To resolve this, you need to align the time zone of your VPS with your local machine's time zone or ensure that the server application is correctly using UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) to avoid time zone issues.

Here are a few steps you can follow:

### 1. Check the current time zone on the VPS
Run the following command to check the current time zone on your VPS:

```bash
timedatectl
```

This will give you an output similar to:

```bash
               Local time: Mon 2024-11-07 14:00:00 UTC
           Universal time: Mon 2024-11-07 14:00:00 UTC
                 RTC time: Mon 2024-11-07 14:00:00
                Time zone: UTC (UTC, +0000)
```

The `Time zone` section will tell you what time zone your VPS is using.

### 2. Change the time zone on the VPS (if needed)
If your VPS is not in the correct time zone, you can change it using the following command:

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone <YourTimeZone>
```

For example, if you're in New York (Eastern Time), you would set the time zone to `America/New_York`:

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York
```

To find a list of available time zones, you can run:

```bash
timedatectl list-timezones
```

### 3. Synchronize the time using NTP
Ensure that your VPS is synchronizing its time with an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server. You can enable NTP synchronization using the following command:

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

This ensures that the time on your VPS is always accurate and synchronized with internet time servers.

### 4. Verify the changes
After setting the correct time zone, you can verify it again with:

```bash
timedatectl
```

Also, you can check the time by running:

```bash
date
```

### 5. Update your server application (if necessary)
If your application is handling time-based functionality (e.g., logging, timestamps), it might be better to store all time-related data in UTC to avoid time zone issues in the future. You can convert the time to the local time zone only when displaying it to the user.

For example, in many programming languages (like Python, Node.js, etc.), you can use libraries that manage time zones and UTC:

- **Node.js**: Use the `moment-timezone` or `luxon` library to handle time zone conversions.
- **Python**: Use the `pytz` library to handle time zones effectively.

### 6. Restart your application (if needed)
If your application is time-sensitive, you may need to restart it to ensure it picks up the new time zone settings.
